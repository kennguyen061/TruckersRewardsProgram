Below is the command to ssh to the our ec2 instance.
ssh -i labsuser.pem ubuntu@ec2-44-195-113-118.compute-1.amazonaws.com

You may need to change the directory of the pem file depending on how your store it.
labsuser.ppk is also included in this file if you need it.


A few things to note about the EC2:
1. to comply with automated testing and deploying code no files should be directly uploaded to this instance. This will prevent code that has not been reviewed from entering our server.

2. It is running Nginx as its webserver. If you need documentation there is a link in James' research upload from sprint 1.

3. NPM and Node are already installed on the system. 

Reach out if you have an questions!
